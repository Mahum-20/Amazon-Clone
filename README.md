# Amazon-Clone
This is not an exact clone. It is without seller component like there are no 3rd party sellers but only amazon which can sell items. There is an admin panel with defined credentials(admin@example.com and password:admin) and theres a dashboard from where admin can add, delete, update and get products and same with categories.
This project is in Django and the frontend is in vanilla html, bootstrap, vanilla javascript and some aditional css.
